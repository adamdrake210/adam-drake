# Hi, I'm Adam Drake

I am really enjoying Nextjs and Typescript on the FrontEnd at the moment. I am also diving deeper into the Backend learning more about Graphql and integration testing. I am also expanding my knowledge of databases with a couple of projects at the moment using mongodb and Postgres. Please see my projects below.
