  This is a marketplace for helping people find flats or rooms to rent in the Czech Republic. It is built using Nextjs and Typescript on the Front End and Node.js/Express on the backend with Rest APIs. I have recently been involved in transferring some of the backend over to GraphQl and writing
  integration tests using Jest.
