# About Me

Started as a Web Developer in 2014. Been refining my skills ever since. Currently focusing on React whilst working as a Web Developer for eBay in Prague, CZ.
I love Web Development and all the innovation that comes along with it. I am always trying to learn new tools and processes in order to improve my workflow and build better apps. To see what I am currently working on please check out the Projects section. Feel free to get in contact if you want to know more.
